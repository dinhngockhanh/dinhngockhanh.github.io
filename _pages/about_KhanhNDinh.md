Khanh N. Dinh is an [Associate Research Scientist](https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu/khanh-ngoc-dinh-phd) in the [Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics](https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu) and the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu) (2023-present).
He earned a Bachelor degree in Mathematics from the [University of Sciences](https://www.math.hcmus.edu.vn/en/) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (2009-2012). He then obtained a PhD degree in Mathematics at the [University of Alabama](https://math.ua.edu), advised by Dr. [Roger Sidje](https://math.ua.edu/people/roger-b-sidje/) (2013-2018). Afterward, he was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in Dr. [Marek Kimmel](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/marek-kimmel)'s lab at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) (2018-2019) and Dr. [Simon Tavar√©](https://tavarelab.cancerdynamics.columbia.edu)'s lab at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu) (2019-2023).

He has a documented track record in developing novel mathematical models and computational methods to infer how tumors evolve from DNA-sequencing data, toward improving patient classification and treatment. Most of his work is in collaboration with mathematicians and statisticians on one side and biologists, geneticists and physicians on the other.
