I have a documented track record in developing novel mathematical models and computational methods to infer how tumors evolve from DNA-sequencing data, toward improving patient classification and treatment. Most of my work is in collaboration with mathematicians and statisticians on one side and biologists, geneticists and physicians on the other.
