  abstract={The finite state projection (FSP) method has enabled us to solve the chemical master equation of some biological models that were considered out of reach not long ago. Since the original FSP method, much effort has gone into transforming it into an adaptive time-stepping algorithm as well as studying its accuracy. Some of the improvements include the multiple time interval FSP, the sliding windows, and most notably the Krylov-FSP approach. Our goal in this tutorial is to give the reader an overview of the current methods that build on the FSP.}

  abstract={Krylov subspace methods have proved quite effective at approximating the action of a large sparse matrix exponential on a vector. Their numerical robustness and matrix-free nature have enabled them to make inroads into a variety of applications. A case in point is solving the chemical master equation (CME) in the context of modeling biochemical reactions in biological cells. This is a challenging problem that gives rise to an extremely large matrix due to the curse of dimensionality. Inexact Krylov subspace methods that build on truncation techniques have helped solve some CME models that were considered computationally out of reach as recently as a few years ago. However, as models grow, truncating them means using an even smaller fraction of their whole extent, thereby introducing more inexactness. But experimental evidence suggests an apparent success and the aim of this study is to give theoretical insights into the reasons why. Essentially, we show that the truncation can be put in the framework of inexact Krylov methods that relax matrix–vector products and compute them expediently by trading accuracy for speed. This allows us to analyze both the residual (or defect) and the error of the resulting approximations to the matrix exponential from the viewpoint of inexact Krylov methods.}

  abstract={Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) have traditionally been employed in gene regulation problems. However, there has been increasing interest to directly obtain the probability distribution of the molecules involved by solving the chemical master equation (CME). This requires addressing the curse of dimensionality that is inherent in most gene regulation problems. The finite state projection (FSP) seeks to address the challenge and there have been variants that further reduce the size of the projection or that accelerate the resulting matrix exponential. The Krylov-FSP-SSA variant has proved numerically efficient by combining, on one hand, the SSA to adaptively drive the FSP, and on the other hand, adaptive Krylov techniques to evaluate the matrix exponential. Here we apply this Krylov-FSP-SSA to a mutual inhibitory gene network synthetically engineered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which bimodality arises. We show numerically that the approach can efficiently approximate the transient probability distribution, and this has important implications for parameter fitting, where the CME has to be solved for many different parameter sets. The fitting scheme amounts to an optimization problem of finding the parameter set so that the transient probability distributions fit the observations with maximum likelihood. We compare five optimization schemes for this difficult problem, thereby providing further insights into this approach of parameter estimation that is often applied to models in systems biology where there is a need to calibrate free parameters.}

  abstract={The chemical master equation (CME) is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the chemical interaction of molecular species. The largeness of the state space of the system makes solving the CME difficult, and this has motivated reduction strategies such as the finite state projection (FSP). Moreover, if the reaction rates are functions of the time, the CME becomes an ODE problem with time-dependent coefficients. Solution techniques include Monte Carlo algorithms, such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or ODE solvers, such as Adams-PECE, Runge-Kutta and backward-differentiation formula (BDF). There are also Magnus-based solvers that have however not been thoroughly explored in the CME context. Here we introduce an adaptive time-stepping Magnus-SSA algorithm, in which the CME is solved using a Magnus expansion with not only a variable time-step but also with a variable state space that changes at each step via the SSA, and several error approximation approaches are attempted to monitor the adaptivity. We perform comparative tests against the classical Adams-PECE, Runge-Kutta and BDF methods on three biological problems, showing that the proposed adaptive Magnus-based variants can be efficient when the CME with time-dependent rates is stiff.}

  abstract={Many traditional approaches for solving the chemical master equation (CME) cannot be used in their basic form when reaction rates change over time, for instance due to cell volume or temperature. One technique is to use the Magnus expansion to represent the solution to the CME as the action of a matrix exponential, for which Krylov-based approximation methods can be applied. In this paper, we compare two variants of the Magnus scheme with some popular ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers, such as Adams-Bashforth, Runge-Kutta and Backward-differentiation formula (BDF). Our numerical tests show that the Magnus variants are remarkably efficient at computing the transient probability distributions of a transcriptional regulatory system where propensities vary over time due to cell volume increase.}

  abstract={Bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) are leukemia predisposition syndromes. We focus here on the transition from SCN to pre-leukemic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Stochastic mathematical models have been conceived that attempt to explain the transition of SCN to MDS, in the most parsimonious way, using extensions of standard processes of population genetics and population dynamics, such as the branching and the Moran processes. We previously presented a hypothesis of the SCN to MDS transition, which involves directional selection and recurrent mutation, to explain the distribution of ages at onset of MDS or AML. Based on experimental and clinical data and a model of human hematopoiesis, a range of probable values of the selection coefficient s and mutation rate μ have been determined. These estimates lead to predictions of the age at onset of MDS or AML, which are consistent with the clinical data. In the current paper, based on data extracted from published literature, we seek to provide an independent validation of these estimates. We proceed with two purposes in mind: (i) to determine the ballpark estimates of the selection coefficients and verify their consistency with those previously obtained and (ii) to provide possible insight into the role of recurrent mutations of the G-CSF receptor in the SCN to MDS transition.}
