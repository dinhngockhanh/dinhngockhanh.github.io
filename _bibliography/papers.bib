  abstract={The finite state projection (FSP) method has enabled us to solve the chemical master equation of some biological models that were considered out of reach not long ago. Since the original FSP method, much effort has gone into transforming it into an adaptive time-stepping algorithm as well as studying its accuracy. Some of the improvements include the multiple time interval FSP, the sliding windows, and most notably the Krylov-FSP approach. Our goal in this tutorial is to give the reader an overview of the current methods that build on the FSP.}

  abstract={Krylov subspace methods have proved quite effective at approximating the action of a large sparse matrix exponential on a vector. Their numerical robustness and matrix-free nature have enabled them to make inroads into a variety of applications. A case in point is solving the chemical master equation (CME) in the context of modeling biochemical reactions in biological cells. This is a challenging problem that gives rise to an extremely large matrix due to the curse of dimensionality. Inexact Krylov subspace methods that build on truncation techniques have helped solve some CME models that were considered computationally out of reach as recently as a few years ago. However, as models grow, truncating them means using an even smaller fraction of their whole extent, thereby introducing more inexactness. But experimental evidence suggests an apparent success and the aim of this study is to give theoretical insights into the reasons why. Essentially, we show that the truncation can be put in the framework of inexact Krylov methods that relax matrix–vector products and compute them expediently by trading accuracy for speed. This allows us to analyze both the residual (or defect) and the error of the resulting approximations to the matrix exponential from the viewpoint of inexact Krylov methods.}

  abstract={Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) have traditionally been employed in gene regulation problems. However, there has been increasing interest to directly obtain the probability distribution of the molecules involved by solving the chemical master equation (CME). This requires addressing the curse of dimensionality that is inherent in most gene regulation problems. The finite state projection (FSP) seeks to address the challenge and there have been variants that further reduce the size of the projection or that accelerate the resulting matrix exponential. The Krylov-FSP-SSA variant has proved numerically efficient by combining, on one hand, the SSA to adaptively drive the FSP, and on the other hand, adaptive Krylov techniques to evaluate the matrix exponential. Here we apply this Krylov-FSP-SSA to a mutual inhibitory gene network synthetically engineered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which bimodality arises. We show numerically that the approach can efficiently approximate the transient probability distribution, and this has important implications for parameter fitting, where the CME has to be solved for many different parameter sets. The fitting scheme amounts to an optimization problem of finding the parameter set so that the transient probability distributions fit the observations with maximum likelihood. We compare five optimization schemes for this difficult problem, thereby providing further insights into this approach of parameter estimation that is often applied to models in systems biology where there is a need to calibrate free parameters.}

  abstract={The chemical master equation (CME) is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the chemical interaction of molecular species. The largeness of the state space of the system makes solving the CME difficult, and this has motivated reduction strategies such as the finite state projection (FSP). Moreover, if the reaction rates are functions of the time, the CME becomes an ODE problem with time-dependent coefficients. Solution techniques include Monte Carlo algorithms, such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or ODE solvers, such as Adams-PECE, Runge-Kutta and backward-differentiation formula (BDF). There are also Magnus-based solvers that have however not been thoroughly explored in the CME context. Here we introduce an adaptive time-stepping Magnus-SSA algorithm, in which the CME is solved using a Magnus expansion with not only a variable time-step but also with a variable state space that changes at each step via the SSA, and several error approximation approaches are attempted to monitor the adaptivity. We perform comparative tests against the classical Adams-PECE, Runge-Kutta and BDF methods on three biological problems, showing that the proposed adaptive Magnus-based variants can be efficient when the CME with time-dependent rates is stiff.}

  abstract={Many traditional approaches for solving the chemical master equation (CME) cannot be used in their basic form when reaction rates change over time, for instance due to cell volume or temperature. One technique is to use the Magnus expansion to represent the solution to the CME as the action of a matrix exponential, for which Krylov-based approximation methods can be applied. In this paper, we compare two variants of the Magnus scheme with some popular ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers, such as Adams-Bashforth, Runge-Kutta and Backward-differentiation formula (BDF). Our numerical tests show that the Magnus variants are remarkably efficient at computing the transient probability distributions of a transcriptional regulatory system where propensities vary over time due to cell volume increase.}

  abstract={Bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) are leukemia predisposition syndromes. We focus here on the transition from SCN to pre-leukemic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Stochastic mathematical models have been conceived that attempt to explain the transition of SCN to MDS, in the most parsimonious way, using extensions of standard processes of population genetics and population dynamics, such as the branching and the Moran processes. We previously presented a hypothesis of the SCN to MDS transition, which involves directional selection and recurrent mutation, to explain the distribution of ages at onset of MDS or AML. Based on experimental and clinical data and a model of human hematopoiesis, a range of probable values of the selection coefficient s and mutation rate μ have been determined. These estimates lead to predictions of the age at onset of MDS or AML, which are consistent with the clinical data. In the current paper, based on data extracted from published literature, we seek to provide an independent validation of these estimates. We proceed with two purposes in mind: (i) to determine the ballpark estimates of the selection coefficients and verify their consistency with those previously obtained and (ii) to provide possible insight into the role of recurrent mutations of the G-CSF receptor in the SCN to MDS transition.}

  abstract={Recent years have seen considerable work on inference about cancer evolution from mutations identified in cancer samples. Much of the modeling work has been based on classical models of population genetics, generalized to accommodate time-varying cell population size. Reverse-time, genealogical views of such models, commonly known as coalescents, have been used to infer aspects of the past of growing populations. Another approach is to use branching processes, the simplest scenario being the classical linear birth-death process. Inference from evolutionary models of DNA often exploits summary statistics of the sequence data, a common one being the so-called Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS). In a bulk tumor sequencing experiment, we can estimate for each site at which a novel somatic point mutation has arisen, the proportion of cells that carry that mutation. These numbers are then grouped into collections of sites which have similar mutant fractions. We examine how the SFS based on birth-death processes differs from those based on the coalescent model. This may stem from the different sampling mechanisms in the two approaches. However, we also show that despite this, they are quantitatively comparable for the range of parameters typical for tumor cell populations. We also present a model of tumor evolution with selective sweeps, and demonstrate how it may help in understanding the history of a tumor as well as the influence of data pre-processing. We illustrate the theory with applications to several examples from The Cancer Genome Atlas tumors.}

  abstract={Event-free and overall survival remain poor for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Chemoresistant clones contributing to relapse arise from minimal residual disease (MRD) or newly acquired mutations. However, the dynamics of clones comprising MRD is poorly understood. We developed a predictive stochastic model, based on a multitype age-dependent Markov branching process, to describe how random events in MRD contribute to the heterogeneity in treatment response. We employed training and validation sets of patients who underwent whole-genome sequencing and for whom mutant clone frequencies at diagnosis and relapse were available. The disease evolution and treatment outcome are subject to stochastic fluctuations. Estimates of malignant clone growth rates, obtained by model fitting, are consistent with published data. Using the estimates from the training set, we developed a function linking MRD and time of relapse with MRD inferred from the model fits to clone frequencies and other data. An independent validation set confirmed our model. In a third dataset, we fitted the model to data at diagnosis and remission and predicted the time to relapse. As a conclusion, given bone marrow genome at diagnosis and MRD at or past remission, the model can predict time to relapse and help guide treatment decisions to mitigate relapse.}

  abstract={Whole-organ mapping was used to study molecular changes in the evolution of bladder cancer from field effects. We identified more than 100 dysregulated pathways, involving immunity, differentiation, and transformation, as initiators of carcinogenesis. Dysregulation of interleukins signified the involvement of inflammation in the incipient phases of the process. An aberrant methylation/expression of multiple HOX genes signified dysregulation of the differentiation program. We identified three types of mutations based on their geographic distribution. The most common were mutations restricted to individual mucosal samples that targeted uroprogenitor cells. Two types of mutations were associated with clonal expansion and involved large areas of mucosa. The $\alpha$ mutations occurred at low frequencies while the $\beta$ mutations increased in frequency with disease progression. Modeling revealed that bladder carcinogenesis spans 10-15 years and can be divided into dormant and progressive phases. The progressive phase lasted 1-2 years and was driven by $\beta$ mutations.}

Recently, McFarland et al. introduced the Tug-of-War model for the joint effect of rare advantageous drivers and frequent but deleterious passengers. We examine this model under two common but distinct frameworks, the Moran model and the branching process. We show that frequently used statistics are similar between a version of the Moran model and the branching process conditioned on the final cell count, under different selection scenarios. We infer the selection coefficients for three breast cancer samples, resulting in good fits of the shape of their Site Frequency Spectra. All fitted values for the selective disadvantage of passenger mutations are nonzero, supporting the view that they exert deleterious selection during tumorigenesis that driver mutations must compensate.}

Accurate patient survival prediction is critical, motivating the exploration of various -omics datasets using machine learning methods. Leveraging multi-omics data, this study seeks to enhance the accuracy of survival prediction by proposing new feature extraction techniques combined with unbiased feature selection. Two lung adenocarcinoma multi-omics datasets, originating from the TCGA and CPTAC-3 projects, were employed for this purpose, emphasizing gene expression, methylation, and mutations as the most relevant data sources that provide features for the survival prediction models. Additionally, gene set aggregation was shown to be the most effective feature extraction method for mutation and copy number variation data. Using the TCGA dataset, we identified 32 molecular features that allowed the construction of a 2-year survival prediction model with an AUC of 0.839. The selected features were additionally tested on an independent CPTAC-3 dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.815 in nested cross-validation, which confirmed the robustness of the identified features.}
