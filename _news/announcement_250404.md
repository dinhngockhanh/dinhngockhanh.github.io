We published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012902">a new paper in PLoS Computational Biology</a> to introduce CINner, a novel computational framework for studying chromosomal instability.
A related press release from IICD can be read <a href="https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu/news/cinner-new-computational-framework-sheds-light-cancer-evolution">here</a>.
Read more <a href="https://dinhngockhanh.github.io/projects/project_CIN_inference/">here</a> about how CINner forms an integral basis for our ongoing efforts to characterize the selection forces driving specific cancer types using bulk and single-cell DNA data.
