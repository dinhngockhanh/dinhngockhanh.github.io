We introduce <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.27.702030v1">BESTish</a>, a novel parameter estimation method utilizing explicit mean-field dynamics and Gaussian-Markov approximations to infer mutation rates and selection coefficients for drivers of clonal hematopoiesis.
BESTish is available on <a href="https://github.com/dinhngockhanh/BESTish">Github</a>, and can be applied to data from either population-level or longitudinal studies, with potential applications in other biological contexts.
