We published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-67842-9">a new work in Scientific Reports</a>, which dives into the problem of inferring rates of chromosomal instability, such as chromosome missegregation rate, and selection coefficients from single-cell DNA-sequencing data. Read more <a href="https://dinhngockhanh.github.io/projects/project_CIN_inference/">here</a> about our ongoing efforts to characterize the selection forces driving specific cancer types using bulk and single-cell DNA data.
